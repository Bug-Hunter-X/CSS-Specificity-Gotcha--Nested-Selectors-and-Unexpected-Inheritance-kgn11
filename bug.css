The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

.special div {
  color: green;
}

.special p {
  color: purple;
}
```

The unexpected behavior arises when you use the `.special div` rule.  While it intends to override the `div` rule's `color: blue` for divs *within* a `.special` element, the specificity of `.special div` is higher than `div`, but not as high as `.special p`.  It's easy to assume that `div` within `.special` would be green, but it might not always behave that way. It actually depends on where the div is nested. If the div is a direct child of the element with the class `.special`, then it will be green. However, if it is a deeper descendant, the specificity of the inherited color will influence the outcome. 

The unexpected behavior comes from the subtle way CSS specificity works, particularly with nested elements.
